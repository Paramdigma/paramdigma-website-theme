# Paramdigma Website Theme

Paramdigma's own Jekyll theme, based on Bulma.js.

It also uses:

- Particles.js - For a fun (but optional) effect in the page headers.
- Three.js - For fast injectable 3D viewer
- Typewritter.js - Typewritter effects on subtitles

## Install

1. Add the following to your Gemfile

  ```ruby
  gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
  ```

  and run `bundle install` to install the plugin
2. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml` to activate the plugin

  ```yml
  plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme
  ```

  Note: If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.
